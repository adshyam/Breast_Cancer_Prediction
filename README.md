# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for breast cancer diagnosis using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic 
and also. at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

It consists of various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass samples, and the task is to classify the samples as malignant or benign.


The following machine learning models were developed and evaluated for breast cancer diagnosis:

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

The models were trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, and F1 score.
